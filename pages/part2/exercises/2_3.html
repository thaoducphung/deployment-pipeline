  <h1>2.3</h1>

  As we saw previously, starting an application with two programs was not trivial and the commands got a bit long.

  In the previous part we created Dockerfiles for both [frontend](https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-backend).
  Next, simplify the usage into one docker-compose.yml.

  Configure the backend and frontend from part 1 to work in docker-compose.

  Submit the docker-compose.yml
