# Running and stopping containers #

Next we will start using a more useful image than hello-world. We can run ubuntu just with `docker run ubuntu`.

```console
$ docker run ubuntu
  Unable to find image 'ubuntu:latest' locally
  latest: Pulling from library/ubuntu
  83ee3a23efb7: Pull complete 
  db98fc6f11f0: Pull complete 
  f611acd52c6c: Pull complete 
  Digest: sha256:703218c0465075f4425e58fac086e09e1de5c340b12976ab9eb8ad26615c3715
  Status: Downloaded newer image for ubuntu:latest
```

Anticlimactic as nothing really happened. The image was downloaded and ran and that was the end of that. It actually tried to open a shell but we will need to add a few flags to interact with it. `-t` will create a tty.

```console
$ docker run -t ubuntu
  root@f83969ce2cd1:/#
```

Now we're inside the container and if we input `ls` and press enter... nothing happens. Because our terminal is not sending the messages into the container. The `-i` flag will instruct to pass the STDIN to the container. If you're stuck with the other terminal you can just stop the container.

```console
$ docker run -it ubuntu
  root@2eb70ecf5789:/# ls
  bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib32  lib64  libx32  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
```

Great! Now we know at least 3 useful flags. `-i` (interactive), `-t` (tty) and `-d` (detached). 

Let's throw in a few more and run a container in the background:

```console
$ docker run -d -it --name looper ubuntu sh -c 'while true; do date; sleep 1; done'
```

> If you are command prompt (Windows) user you must use double quotes around the script i.e. `docker run -d -it --name looper ubuntu sh -c "while true; do date; sleep 1; done"`. The quote or double-quote may haunt you later during the course.

- The first part, `docker run -d`. Should be familiar by now, run container detached.

- Followed by `-it` is short for `-i` and `-t`. Also familiar, `-it` allows you to interact with the container by using the command line.

- Because we ran the container with `--name looper`, we can now reference it easily.

- The image is `ubuntu` and what follows it is the command given to the container.

And to check that it's running, run `docker container ls`

Let's follow `-f` the output of logs with

```console
$ docker logs -f looper
  Thu Feb  4 15:51:29 UTC 2021
  Thu Feb  4 15:51:30 UTC 2021
  Thu Feb  4 15:51:31 UTC 2021
  ... 
```

Let's test pausing the looper without exiting or stopping it. In another terminal run `docker pause looper`. Notice how the logs output has paused in the first terminal. To unpause run `docker unpause looper`.

Keep the logs open and attach to the running container from the second terminal using 'attach': 

```console
$ docker attach looper 
  Mon Jan 15 19:26:54 UTC 2018 
  Mon Jan 15 19:26:55 UTC 2018 
  ...
```

Now you have process logs (STDOUT) running in two terminals. Now press control+c in the attached window. The container is stopped because the process is no longer running.

If we want to attach to a container while making sure we don't close it from the other terminal we can specify to not attach STDIN with `--no-stdin` option. Let's start the stopped container with `docker start looper` and attach to it with `--no-stdin`. 

Then try control+c.

```console
$ docker start looper 

$ docker attach --no-stdin looper 
  Mon Jan 15 19:27:54 UTC 2018 
  Mon Jan 15 19:27:55 UTC 2018 
  ^C 
```

The container will continue running. Control+c now only disconnects you from the STDOUT. 

To enter a container, we can start a new process in it.

```console
$ docker exec -it looper bash 

  root@2a49df3ba735:/# ps aux 

  USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
  root         1  0.2  0.0   2612  1512 pts/0    Ss+  12:36   0:00 sh -c while true; do date; sleep 1; done
  root        64  1.5  0.0   4112  3460 pts/1    Ss   12:36   0:00 bash
  root        79  0.0  0.0   2512   584 pts/0    S+   12:36   0:00 sleep 1
  root        80  0.0  0.0   5900  2844 pts/1    R+   12:36   0:00 ps aux
```

From the `ps aux` listing we can see that our `bash` process got PID (process ID) of 64.  

Now that we're inside the container it behaves as you'd expect from ubuntu, and we can exit the container with `exit` and then either kill or stop the container.

Our looper won't stop for a SIGTERM signal sent by a stop command. To terminate the process, stop follows the SIGTERM with a SIGKILL after a grace period. In this case, it's simply faster to use kill.

```console
$ docker kill looper 
$ docker rm looper 
```

Running the previous two commands is basically equivalent to running `docker rm --force looper` 

Let's start another process with `-it` and add `--rm` in order to remove it automatically after it has exited. The `--rm` ensures that there are no garbage containers left behind. It also means that `docker start` can not be used to start the container after it has exited. 

```console
$ docker run -d --rm -it --name looper-it ubuntu sh -c 'while true; do date; sleep 1; done' 
```

Now let's attach to the container and hit control+p, control+q to detach us from the STDOUT.

```console
$ docker attach looper-it 

  Mon Jan 15 19:50:42 UTC 2018 
  Mon Jan 15 19:50:43 UTC 2018 
  ^P^Qread escape sequence
```

Instead, if we had used ctrl+c, it would have sent a kill signal followed by removing the container as we specified --rm in `docker run` command.
