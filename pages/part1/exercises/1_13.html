  <b style="color:firebrick;">This exercise is mandatory</b>

  Clone, fork or download a project from
  [https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-backend](https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-backend).

  Create a Dockerfile for the project (example-backend) and give a command so that the project runs in a docker container with port 8080
  published. 
  
  When you start the container and navigate to [http://localhost:8080/ping](http://localhost:8080/ping) you should get a "pong" as response.

  Submit the Dockerfile and the command used.

  *Do not alter the code of the project*
