  <h1>3.6: Multi-stage backend</h1>
  Lets do a multi-stage build for the [backend](https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-backend) project since we've come so far with the application.

  The project is in golang and building a binary that runs in a container, while straightforward, isn't exactly trivial. Use resources that you have available (Google, example projects) to build the binary and run it inside a container that uses FROM scratch.

  To pass the exercise the image must be smaller than <b>25MB</b>.
