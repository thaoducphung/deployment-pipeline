## Passing ##

To get a passing grade, you have to do every exercise, except you can skip one exercise for each part. You can **not** "save" skips between parts and skip two exercises in a later part. Some of the exercises are marked as mandatory, and they can not be skipped.

## Deadline ##

The sign up for ECTS credits ends 12.12.2021! The course ends 13.12.2021. After that course is locked and submissions can no longer be made or credits earned. As the certificate is received through submissions, you have to submit everything before the course ends. More details under completion and after each part.

## General guidance ##

*Do not alter the code of the projects, unless by pull-requests to the original projects*

You do not need to touch ruby, java, js or python code during this course. You may have to read their error messages.

Visit the telegram channel if you are stuck!

## How to return exercises ##

Make a repository to GitHub and publish your solutions in clearly ordered files / folders.
If you need help publishing using git you should refer to their [guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). Make sure that the repository is available to me, either by using a public repository or a private repository and adding Jakousa as a collaborator.

Most of the exercises will be focused on a Dockerfile and/or docker-compose.yml and in those cases submitting the file is enough. In other cases a picture or copy-paste from your command line or a link to docker hub and/or project inside the repository is enough. For the command line exercises at start the command `script` ([https://linux.die.net/man/1/script](https://linux.die.net/man/1/script)) may be helpful.

When you have completed a part, use the [submission application](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/stats/courses/docker2021) to mark your exercises. You can **not** edit a submission so make sure you have completed enough exercises for a part before submitting.

## Completing ##

The certificate is available from the small icon beneath your submissions!

After you have returned all of the required exercises and wish to end your course completion and want the ECTS credits press the following button in the submission application (ignore the message about an "exam" as there is no exam in this course):

![]({{ "/images/incomplete_course.png" | absolute_url }})

After that, ensure that the application has the message "Course marked as completed" and the date. 

![]({{ "/images/completed_course.png" | absolute_url }})
